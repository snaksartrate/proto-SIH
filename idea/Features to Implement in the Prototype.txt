Features to Implement Fully

1. Map & Tracking (Google Maps API)

   * Show user’s current location.
   * Simulate a tour route (could just be pre-defined points).
   * Allow basic navigation/tracking.

2. Chatbot (ChatGPT API)

   * Ask touristy questions (“What to do near Gateway of India?”).
   * Get AI-generated answers in conversational style.
   * Bonus: Multi-language support.

3. SOS Service (Indigenous Implementation)

   * Volume-down button long-press → sends SOS text to dummy number + shows alert.
   * Share location in the SOS message.
   * Mock video/audio option (store locally, no real send).

Features to Prototype with Mockups / Limited Integration

4. Accommodation & Ride Booking

   * Instead of integrating Booking.com, Airbnb, Ola, Uber, RedBus all at once →
   * Use scraper + aggregator prototype:

     * Example: query one site via API (e.g., Booking.com’s open API).
     * For others, show mock data / dummy deals (static JSON).
   * Present the “best deal” algorithm (even if data is limited).

5. Smart Itinerary Planner (AI)

   * Keep a rule-based + ChatGPT hybrid:

     * Rule-based: “If user likes food → suggest top 3 restaurants nearby.”
     * AI: Use GPT to polish the itinerary into a “tour guide tone.”
   * Works as a teaser of what full AI-planner can be.

Features to **Keep as Placeholders**

6. Tour Packages

   * Just show pre-designed packages (static content).
   * Label as “Coming Soon: Dynamic Packages.”

7. Scam Alerts / Community Reports

   * Mock alerts (“Beware of overcharging taxis near XYZ”).
   * Indicate crowd-sourced data as future scope.







Deliverable Prototype

* APK with:
  ✅ Maps tracking
  ✅ Chatbot
  ✅ SOS trigger
  🟡 Accommodation + Ride search (limited but working)
  🟡 Basic itinerary planner

* Other features → well-presented placeholders in the UI (greyed out, “Coming Soon”).

👉 This way, the app **feels real and useful** in the demo (since maps/chatbot/SOS actually work), while still showcasing the **big vision** (planner, aggregator, scam alerts, packages).
